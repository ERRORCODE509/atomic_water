    "description": "Heavy water consists of one oxygen atom and two deuterium atoms, a stable isotope of hydrogen also known as hydrogen-2. It has a density of 1.107 g/mL, making it about 10% heavier than ordinary water. Said to taste slightly sweet.\n\nThere is a common misconception that heavy water is radioactive, when in fact it is not. It is mostly safe to consume, as there are no health effects until about 25% of the water in the body has been replaced by heavy water. It is lethal in mammals when 50% of the water in their body has been replaced by heavy water, though it hasn't been tested on humans to this concentration.",
